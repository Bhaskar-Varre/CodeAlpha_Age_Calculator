# CodeAlpha_Age_Calculator

As a part of my INTERNSHIP with CODEALPHA, I have completed my Task 2  of Age Calculator using html, css and JavaScript.

Here I Created a web-based Age Calculator using JavaScript to calculate users' age based on their submitted date of birth, month, and year. 

JavaScript's built-in date and time functions simplify the age calculation process, making it easy to determine someone's age.
